<!--
  Easiest way to reproduce is with the input event of a text box since you
  can mash on the keyboard.
-->
<input type="text" placeholder="input" (input)="onInput($event)" />

<!--
  While not as easy to reproduce, it's still possible to see the issue with
  the click event if the handler updates the bound value.
-->
<button type="button" (click)="onButton()">BUTTON</button>

<!-- 
  The value that is being updated by the event handler needs to be bound in the
  template.
-->
<p>Value: {{value}}</p>


<!--
  An input property on the child component is not required to reproduce the
  issue, this is just a way to have the <img /> reload within it.
-->
<child [thing]="thing"></child>
